      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a musician who has been playing in underground bands for the last 16 years, and a cook to make a living. I'm trying to find a more lucrative career so I can continue to make music but not have to worry about money or job status.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm originally from Chicago. I lived in Denver for 8 years before heading further west to Portland</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Other than playing music, I'm a bit of a movie buff, and I enjoy collecting 80's horror VHS tapes.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I originally went to school for film, and I'm still passionate for it, so I think my dream job would be a film director.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently reside in Portland OR.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>To get out of the kitchen industry into a more lucrative career that is ever growing.</p>
